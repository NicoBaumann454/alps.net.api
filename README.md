# alsp.net.api
C# Library which lets you parse OWL files containing subject-oriented process models that follow the standards of the standard-pass-ont and abstract-layered-pass ont standard.

 

The library will create in-memory versions of the (AL)PASS models that can be used by other applications. This can be done either by querying the in-memory model, or by extending the classes of the library in order to add own functionality (e.g. for execution).
